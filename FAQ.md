## 💳 Payment & Access

### 🔹 Why is there a protection fee for accessing the blueprint?
MaxOneCloud follows an open-source model, but access to the blueprint requires a **one-time protection fee of €900**, payable in cryptocurrency.  
This is **not a commercial charge** – it ensures **legal protection** for all licensees and prevents BigTech from taking control over the technology.

### 🔹 Why €900 and not €1?
The fee reflects the **actual cost of creating the documentation**.  
- The documentation took **90 days** to complete.
- Estimated cost per day: **€10**.
- **90 days × €10/day = €900**.

A lower fee (e.g., €1) would be **legally meaningless** and could not establish a valid contractual framework.

### 🔹 How do I obtain the blueprint?
1. **Accept the License** → Read and agree to the **TBYD License v2.2**.
2. **Request a Payment Key** → Each payment key is unique and linked to a licensee.
3. **Complete the Payment** → The fee (€900) must be paid in **cryptocurrency**.
4. **Receive Secure Access** → After verification, you will receive a download link.

### 🔹 Why do I need a Payment Key?
Each licensee receives a **unique payment key**, which serves multiple purposes:
- Ensures **each transaction is linked to an approved licensee**.
- Prevents **automated abuse** or bulk acquisitions by centralized entities.
- Guarantees that every licensee **legally agrees to the TBYD License v2.2**.

Without a valid payment key, **transactions cannot be processed**.

### 🔹 Can I pay in a different cryptocurrency?
Currently, we only accept **Ethereum (ETH)** for payments. If alternative payment methods are needed, contact us directly.

### 🔹 Are there any discounts available?
No. The fee is fixed and is already set at the lowest possible threshold to ensure fairness and accessibility.

### 🔹 What happens if I pay less than €900?
Payments below the required amount will **not be processed**, and access to the blueprint will **not be granted**.

## 🔐 Legal & Security

### 🔹 Why is the blueprint not freely available like other open-source projects?
While MaxOneCloud is fully open-source, unrestricted public access would allow **BigTech to absorb and monopolize the technology**, defeating the purpose of digital sovereignty. The controlled access mechanism ensures that only serious adopters can utilize the blueprint.

### 🔹 What legal protections does the license provide?
- **Prevents patenting by third parties**.
- **Ensures licensees are legally protected** from BigTech attacks.
- **Guarantees compliance with open-source principles** while maintaining sovereignty.

### 🔹 Can I share the blueprint after obtaining it?
No. Redistribution of the blueprint is strictly prohibited under the **TBYD License v2.2**.
