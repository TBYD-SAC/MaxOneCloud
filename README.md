## ðŸ“Œ Why is there a protection fee?

MaxOneCloud follows an open-source philosophy, but access to the blueprint requires a one-time **protection fee of â‚¬900**, payable in cryptocurrency.  
This is **not a commercial charge** â€“ it exists for **legal protection**.

### ðŸ”¹ Why is this necessary?
1. **Protection against legal attacks**: The fee ensures that all licensees are legally bound, preventing hostile takeovers or patent claims by BigTech.
2. **Sovereignty for users**: By legally structuring access, cloud operators and enterprises using MaxOneCloud are protected from lawsuits.
3. **Security against monopolization**: Without this, large corporations could exploit the technology without restrictions.
4. **A legal filter, not a price tag**: The fee is not about making moneyâ€”it ensures only serious adopters gain access.

### ðŸ”¹ Why â‚¬900 and not â‚¬1?
Some may ask why the protection fee is not simply **â‚¬1 or â‚¬10**. The answer is simple:  
- A **symbolic â‚¬1 fee** would be legally meaningless and could be challenged in court.  
- The fee must be **high enough to establish a clear legal agreement**, yet **low enough that it does not exclude serious adopters**.  
- **â‚¬900 was chosen because it directly reflects the real-world cost of creating the documentation.**  

### ðŸ”¹ How was the â‚¬900 fee calculated?
The fee is based on **the actual time investment required** to document MaxOneCloud from scratch:  
- The documentation process took **90 days** to complete.  
- The estimated cost per day was **â‚¬10**, reflecting the time spent on structuring, writing, and validating the blueprint.  
- **90 days Ã— â‚¬10/day = â‚¬900**  

This fee ensures that the **work required to make the system accessible, understandable, and implementable** is fairly recognized. It is not a price for the code itself, but rather for the structured knowledge that allows anyone to deploy MaxOneCloud properly.
