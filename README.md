## **💡 Why is there a 900 THC fee?**  
We understand that charging for access to open-source documentation is uncommon.  
However, this fee is **not a commercial charge** – it exists to protect **future operators** and ensure **MaxOneCloud remains sovereign**.  

✔️ **Legal protection for future operators** → Prevents lawsuits, monopolization & control by external forces  
✔️ **Sovereignty enforcement** → Ensures that cloud operators remain independent from BigTech restrictions  
✔️ **Security & compliance framework** → License verification prevents unauthorized use or misuse  

📌 **Why exactly 900 THC?**  
The amount is **not arbitrary** – it is set deliberately at a level that:  

🔹 **Prevents uncontrolled distribution of the documentation**  
🔹 **Ensures that only serious operators gain access**  
🔹 **Acts as a legal mechanism** to establish a clear contract between the licensee and the provider  

📌 **Conclusion:** The **900 THC fee is not about revenue** – it is about establishing a **legally binding framework** that protects every future **MaxOneCloud operator** from **BigTech legal attacks**.

## **🛡️ Protection Against BigTech Legal Attacks**  
📌 **Why does this matter?**  

✅ **BigTech can no longer attack you with patent lawsuits** → Because the contract legally grants you usage rights  
✅ **MaxOneCloud cannot be shut down or controlled** → Because it is fully decentralized  
✅ **No single entity can be targeted** → Because no single entity owns it
