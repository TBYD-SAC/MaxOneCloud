## 📥 **How to Access MaxOneCloud**  

MaxOneCloud follows an **open-source model**, but access to the implementation framework requires a **one-time legal protection fee of €900 (crypto payment in Ethereum (ETH))**.  

📌 **Step-by-Step Access Process**  
1️⃣ **Accept the TBYD License v2.2**  
2️⃣ **Request a Unique Payment Key** (Prevents abuse & ensures license compliance)  
3️⃣ **Complete the One-Time Payment (€900 in Ethereum (ETH))**  
4️⃣ **Receive Secure Access to the Full MaxOneCloud Repository**  

📢 **Only after verification will access be granted. The process is mandatory and strictly followed.**

## 💡 **Why is there a €900 fee?**  

We understand that charging for access to open-source documentation is **uncommon**.  
However, this fee is **not a commercial charge** – it exists **to protect future operators and ensure MaxOneCloud remains sovereign**.  

✔️ **Legal protection for future operators** → Prevents lawsuits, monopolization & control by external forces  
✔️ **Sovereignty enforcement** → Ensures that cloud operators remain independent from BigTech restrictions  
✔️ **Security & compliance framework** → License verification prevents unauthorized use or misuse  

---

## 📌 **Why exactly €900?**  

The **amount is not arbitrary**, nor is it based on economic factors.  
It is set deliberately at a level that:  

🔹 **Is high enough to prevent uncontrolled distribution of the documentation**  
🔹 **Ensures that only serious operators gain access**  
🔹 **Acts as a legal mechanism to establish a clear contract between the licensee and the provider**  

📌 **Conclusion:** The €900 fee is **not about revenue** – it is about establishing a legally binding framework that **protects every future MaxOneCloud operator from BigTech legal attacks**.  

---

## 🛡️ **Protection Against BigTech Legal Attacks**  

📌 **Why does this matter?**  
- **BigTech can no longer attack you with patent lawsuits** → Because the contract legally grants you usage rights  
- **MaxOneCloud cannot be shut down or controlled** → Because it is fully decentralized  
- **No single entity can be targeted** → Because no single entity owns it
