# Take Back Your Data (TBYD) License v2.2

## Preamble
This license governs the use of the technical blueprints from **Take Back Your Data (TBYD)**. The objective is to ensure an open, decentralized, and non-monopolistic use of the technology while preventing patenting or commercial appropriation by BigTech or other centralized entities.

## 1. Scope of License
- This license grants the **licensee** the right to **use, modify, and implement** the blueprints for their own purposes, provided the conditions set forth in this license are met.
- The blueprints are **non-transferable** and may only be used by authorized licensees.

## 2. Patent Prohibition & Protection Against Monopolization
- The **licensee** agrees **not** to register any **patents, utility models, or similar intellectual property rights** based on the blueprints, nor assist third parties in doing so.
- If a licensee violates this clause, their license **immediately becomes void**, and any derived patents can be challenged via **Third-Party Observation** at relevant patent offices.
- The blueprints are **registered as prior art** in **scientific archives, open-source platforms, and patent law databases** to prevent third-party patenting.
- This license also applies to **subsidiaries or affiliated entities** of the licensee, preventing circumvention.

## 3. Protection Fee & Access
- The licensee gains access to the blueprints **only after paying a one-time protection fee**. This serves as a legal safeguard and prevents uncontrolled distribution.
- Payments are processed via a **neutral trustee** or an **anonymous payment system** (e.g., privacy coins, specialized payment providers).
- Without payment of the protection fee, the **use or distribution of the blueprints is strictly prohibited**.

## 4. Agreement to the License & Proof of Compliance
- The **licensee must explicitly agree** to this license before gaining access to the blueprints.
- Agreement is confirmed via **digital signature** or **trustee verification**.
- The agreement is **documented anonymously** but retained for verification purposes.

## 5. Anonymity of the Licensor & Protection of Licensees
- **TBYD remains fully anonymous** and does not disclose any information about license issuance or licensees.
- Licensee data is **never stored or shared**.
- Access to updates or new versions is granted via **anonymous access tokens**, which are not linked to identities.
- All transactions must be processed through **anonymized payment systems** or **proxy trustees**.

## 6. License Violations & Consequences
If a licensee violates this license (e.g., unauthorized distribution, patenting, or non-compliant usage), the following actions will be taken:
- **Immediate license revocation without reinstatement**.
- **Publication of the violation** via whistleblower networks, tech media, and the open-source community.
- **Potential legal action** from third parties (e.g., companies legally using TBYD blueprints).
- A violating licensee **may be sued for damages** by affected parties.
- Licensees can **report violations anonymously** to protect the integrity of the open-source system.

## 7. Long-Term Safeguarding of the Blueprints
- The blueprints are **decentrally stored on IPFS, Arweave, and mirror servers**, preventing deletion or monopolization.
- They are also published in **scientific archives & patent law databases** to prevent retroactive patenting.
- An **open-source community** is granted access to ensure continuous updates & transparency.
- If central storage locations are attacked or deleted, new versions will be **automatically restored** by distributed networks.

## 8. Final Provisions
- This license **cannot be retroactively amended**.
- If any provisions of this license are found to be **invalid**, the remaining parts shall remain in effect.
- This license is **not subject to any state or jurisdictional control** and is globally applicable.
