## 📥 How to Access MaxOneCloud  

MaxOneCloud follows an **open-source model**, but access to the **implementation framework** requires a **one-time legal protection fee of €900** (paid in **Ethereum (ETH)**).  

### 📌 Step-by-Step Access Process  
1️⃣ **Accept the [TBYD License v2.2](https://github.com/TBYD-SAC/MaxOneCloud/blob/main/LICENSE.md)**  
2️⃣ **Request a Unique Payment Key** (Prevents abuse & ensures license compliance)  
3️⃣ **Complete the One-Time Payment** (€900 in **Ethereum (ETH)**)  
4️⃣ **Receive Secure Access** to the **Full MaxOneCloud Documentation & Repository**  

📢 **Only after verification will access be granted. The process is mandatory and strictly followed.**  

💡 **Why is there a €900 fee?**  
The fee is **not a commercial charge** – it ensures **legal protection** for all licensees & prevents BigTech from taking control over the technology.  

✔️ **Legal protection for future operators** → Prevents lawsuits, monopolization & control by external forces  
✔️ **Sovereignty enforcement** → Ensures that cloud operators remain independent from BigTech restrictions  
✔️ **Security & compliance framework** → License verification prevents unauthorized use or misuse  

📌 **Why exactly €900?**  
The amount is set deliberately at a level that:  

🔹 Is **high enough to prevent uncontrolled distribution**  
🔹 Ensures that **only serious operators** gain access  
🔹 Acts as a **legal mechanism** to establish a clear contract  

📌 **Conclusion:** The **€900 fee is not about revenue** – it is about **establishing a legally binding framework** that protects **every future MaxOneCloud operator** from **BigTech legal attacks**.

## 🛡️ Protection Against BigTech Legal Attacks  

📌 **Why does this matter?**  

✔️ BigTech can **no longer attack you with patent lawsuits** → Because the contract legally grants you usage rights  
✔️ MaxOneCloud **cannot be shut down or controlled** → Because it is **fully decentralized**  
✔️ No single entity **can be targeted** → Because **no single entity owns it**
